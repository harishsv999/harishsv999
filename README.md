# Hi, I'm Venkata Harish S ðŸ‘‹

### Senior Mobile Application Developer | Android Engineer | Kotlin, React, and React Native Enthusiast

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I have over **6.7 years of experience** in developing mobile and web applications across various domains such as **banking, video streaming, finance management,** and more. I'm passionate about solving complex problems, delivering high-quality software, and learning the latest technologies to enhance app performance and user experiences.

## ðŸ”­ What Iâ€™m currently working on:
- Designing **Android apps** with a focus on **user identity, accounts, cards, and transaction functionality**.
- Utilizing **Jetpack Compose** for building modern, responsive UIs.
- Implementing **React Native** for cross-platform mobile development (Android and iOS), ensuring a consistent experience across devices.
  
## ðŸŒ± What Iâ€™m learning next:
- **Kubernetes & Helm**: Diving into container orchestration and microservices architecture for better scalability and automation in cloud-native environments. Learning to manage complex, distributed systems and deploying apps efficiently on **Kubernetes** clusters using **Helm** charts.
- **Swift & SwiftUI**: Expanding my iOS development skillset by learning **Swift** and **SwiftUI** to build native iOS apps. Iâ€™m focusing on the new declarative UI framework **SwiftUI**, alongside **Combine** for reactive programming, to create smooth, modern interfaces for iOS.
- **Advanced React & React Native**: Enhancing my knowledge of **React Hooks**, **Context API**, and performance optimization techniques. I'm learning how to manage state efficiently with **Redux** and exploring **React Native Fabric** and **Turbo Modules** to push performance for cross-platform apps to the next level.
- **Multiplatform Kotlin (Kotlin MPP)**: Delving into **Kotlin Multiplatform** to write shared business logic across Android, iOS, and web applications. Exploring how to share code between platforms to reduce development effort and improve consistency.
- **Jetpack Compose for Desktop**: Exploring the use of **Jetpack Compose** beyond mobile by building responsive UIs for desktop applications, allowing for reusable code across platforms and optimizing for different screen sizes.
- **GraphQL**: Learning **GraphQL** to simplify API interactions, reduce over-fetching of data, and create more efficient, scalable applications. Focusing on using GraphQL with **Apollo Client** for Android and **React**.
- **Serverless Architecture**: Exploring serverless solutions such as **AWS Lambda** and **Google Cloud Functions** to build scalable, event-driven backends with minimal infrastructure management.
- **CI/CD for Mobile Development**: Enhancing knowledge of continuous integration and deployment processes for mobile apps, focusing on automating testing, building, and deployment pipelines using tools like **Bitrise**, **CircleCI**, and **Fastlane**.
- **Mobile App Security**: Strengthening my understanding of mobile app security by learning about **OWASP Mobile Security** practices, securing sensitive data using **encryption**, and ensuring compliance with best security practices across Android and iOS platforms.
- **Performance Optimization**: Deep diving into app performance profiling using tools like **Android Profiler** and **Instruments** on iOS to optimize rendering times, memory usage, and battery consumption.
- **Spring Boot & Kafka**: Learning to integrate **Spring Boot** with **Kafka, Redis**, and other modern backend technologies for scalable backend systems.

## ðŸ’¡ Technologies and Tools:
- **Languages**: Kotlin, Java, Swift, JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS
- **Mobile Frameworks**: Android SDK, Jetpack Compose, React Native, Redux, Firebase, Coroutines
- **Web Frameworks**: ReactJS, Redux, Context API, React Hooks
- **Architecture**: MVVM, MVP, Clean Architecture, SOLID principles
- **Testing & Debugging**: JUnit, Jest, Redux-Thunk, Charles Proxy
- **DevOps & Cloud**: AWS Cloud Practitioner, Git, CICD Pipelines, Docker
- **Other Tools**: Dagger2, Navigation Component, Jetpack Components, Material Components, Retrofit, RxJava

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Contributions & Achievements:
- Developed **custom reusable components** for both Android and iOS using **React Native** to streamline cross-platform development.
- Reduced app size by **40%** through efficient code optimizations in mobile applications.
- Built a **QR code scanner** feature using **Android MLKit** and integrated it seamlessly for payments.
- Enhanced user authentication journeys with **AES encryption** to safeguard sensitive user data.
- Worked with **Redux** and **React Native Elements** to create performant, responsive mobile apps for both **iOS and Android**.

## ðŸš€ Looking Forward to:
- **React Native Contributions**: Building open-source packages and libraries to enhance the development experience for mobile developers using **React Native**.
- Diving deeper into **Swift** for native iOS development, focusing on **SwiftUI** and **Combine** for creating elegant, performant UIs.
- Collaborating on projects involving **Android Jetpack Compose**, **Kotlin Multiplatform**, and **serverless architecture** for cloud-native applications.
- Learning about **CI/CD integration** specifically for mobile applications to automate testing, building, and deployment pipelines.
